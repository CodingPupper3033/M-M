                        &emsp; Our robot did not move, while other robots could move and/or solve the wumpus simulation
                        with various degrees of efficiency; some of which had the capability of solving more complex
                        wumpus problems, while others couldn’t advance past the simplest of them. The shortcomings of
                        the robot were simply due to our shortcomings as people; the mismanagement of time was the fault
                        of no one but us. The algorithm and line traversal code never reached a point of harmony.

                        &emsp; Overall, we learned how to apply the ev3dev2 API to our robot code and utilize the
                        reflective light intensity attribute in order to align the robot with each square border. When
                        turning, we applied a self correcting algorithm utilizing the gyro in order to provide a high
                        precision turn and less room for error. If we could change something from earlier, we would have
                        spread out a plan before implementing it. Instead of designing a pseudocode of the wumpus
                        algorithm, we went straight into programming the robot. Utilizing a gyro to position the robot
                        alignment and color sensors only to provide a border signal would have been more beneficial
                        since the gyro sensor is concretely developed to quantify the robot’s angle.

                        &emsp; Simply put, no; Shaggy is not intelligent. The robot follows a set of pre-programmed
                        instructions. It has no ability to problem solve or to understand the world around itself.
                        Shaggy doesn’t understand what it is trying to accomplish; it is told to move about the board
                        gathering information, and when it reaches a certain spot (the gold) to blindly try getting back
                        to its starting spot. Shaggy has no higher level understanding of the board as a whole either.
                        While it stores information about the board, the only thing that it really knows is information
                        about the square that it is currently on and the squares that are directly adjacent. Having said
                        all this, Shaggy certainly is not conscious and definitely does not have a mind. Shaggy is a
                        robot that does not have interests or even the ability to recognize and understand the world
                        around it. If anything, this project has shown just how far away we are from being able to
                        achieve true artificial intelligence, if it is even possible to attain at all. We would need an
                        algorithm infinitely more complex than the one that runs shaggy to say that he is intelligent.
