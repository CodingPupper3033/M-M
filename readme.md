| X   | A brief description of the Wumpus World problem.                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
|     | Choices that were made in the physical design of the robot, and why.                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
|     | A log book describing your day-by-day efforts: problems you ran into, changes you made, etc                                                                                                                                                                                    |                                                                   |
|     | An informal, high-level, description and explanation of the algorithm used to attack the Wumpus World. Don’t get too detailed here; certainly do not go into any programming details! And don’t post your code!!!                                                              |
|     | A discussion of the round-up: how your robot performed, how others performed, shortcomings of the robot and suggestions for improvement.                                                                                                                                       |
|     | A discussion of the project as it relates to some of the things we talked about in class For example, do you think your robot is intelligent? Is it conscious? Does it have a mind? Do you feel any differently regarding the feasibility of AI now that you did this project? |
|     | And, of course: team members, robot name, logo, slogan, pictures, movies, songs, merchandise, etc. The Works!                                                                                                                                                                  |

## TODO List:

- [x] Team Members Description (image + desired title + sentence about you) - **Still waiting on Anish - Got sick of
  waiting, needed to move on. If you ever respond I can try to add it**
- [ ] What choices were made in physical design? - Ziv & Josh
- [ ] Log Book - Josh (And Further Help from others)
- [ ] Fully Fleshed out light sensing/grid traversal algorithm - Ziv
- [x] Fully Fleshed out traversal algorithm - Patrick & Anish
- [ ] High Level not too detailed explanation of the algorithm - Patrick
- [ ] Implemented light sensing/grid traversal algorithm - Ziv (maybe Josh if needed)
- [ ] Implementation of general grid traversal (~~rotating~~, moving to spot, knowing where the robot is) - Unknown.
  Sort of
- [x] Implementation of communication to the robot (SSH) - Up for grabs. If Ziv finishes light sensing, maybe him? - **
  just just input() and print()**
  all hands on deck, Josh included?
- [ ] Implemented traversal algorithm - Anish (if needed Patrick)
- [ ] Is the robot intelligent, conscious, mindful? Is AI feasible? - Up for grabs; maybe Anish?
- [ ] Team Logo - Josh - ~~Asking, may need to use old one~~ Should get by before Friday
- [ ] "The Works!" - Up for grabs
- [ ] Discussion on roundup - Tentatively Josh
