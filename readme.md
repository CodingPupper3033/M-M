|     | A brief description of the Wumpus World problem.                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
|     | Choices that were made in the physical design of the robot, and why.                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
|     | A log book describing your day-by-day efforts: problems you ran into, changes you made, etc                                                                                                                                                                                    |                                                                   |
|     | An informal, high-level, description and explanation of the algorithm used to attack the Wumpus World. Don’t get too detailed here; certainly do not go into any programming details! And don’t post your code!!!                                                              |
|     | A discussion of the round-up: how your robot performed, how others performed, shortcomings of the robot and suggestions for improvement.                                                                                                                                       |
|     | A discussion of the project as it relates to some of the things we talked about in class For example, do you think your robot is intelligent? Is it conscious? Does it have a mind? Do you feel any differently regarding the feasibility of AI now that you did this project? |
|     | And, of course: team members, robot name, logo, slogan, pictures, movies, songs, merchandise, etc. The Works!                                                                                                                                                                  |
