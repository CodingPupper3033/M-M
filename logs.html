        &emsp;Today, we were introduced to our robot named Shaggy. In addition, we were responsible for disassembling last yearâ€™s Shaggy. After disassembly, we counted, inspected, and organized the lego pieces into the correct compartments. Later on, we learned the game's objective, the rules surrounding it, and where to find instructions and sample code for the project.

        &emsp;To start the day, we had to find our robot. It appears another group borrowed our robot, and we went on a heist to liberate him. In addition, we did a quick, fifteen-minute lecture about Git/GitHub so that we may effectively share the code with each other. While listening to the lecture, some members were also building the robot, and by the end of the class, we were very close to having the robot completely built physically. In addition to building the robot, we looked over the example code and were able to make some of the code run. While we were able to get the sample code to run, we could not get our own code to run on the robot.
