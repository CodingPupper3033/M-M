        &emsp;Today, we were introduced to our robot named Shaggy. In addition, we were responsible for disassembling last year’s Shaggy. After disassembly, we counted, inspected, and organized the lego pieces into the correct compartments. Later on, we learned the game's objective, the rules surrounding it, and where to find instructions and sample code for the project.

          &emsp;To start the day, we had to find our robot. It appears another group borrowed our robot, and we went on
          a heist to liberate him. In addition, we did a quick, fifteen-minute lecture about Git/GitHub so that we may
          effectively share the code with each other. While listening to the lecture, some members were also building
          the robot, and by the end of the class, we were very close to having the robot completely built physically. In
          addition to building the robot, we looked over the example code and could make some of the code run. While we
          were able to get the sample code to run, we could not get our own code to run on the robot.
          <br><br>
          &emsp;In addition, we had a well-crafted README made so that other group members do not need to struggle as
          much as the first member. <small><i> We believe this readme was uploaded to the project website; future
          groups, you’re welcome!</i></small>

                &emsp; Today, everyone had a different role and task to complete. The three biggest tasks were as
                follows:
                <ol>
                    <li>Further website development.</li>
                    <li>Algorithm development for safe grid travel.</li>
                    <li>Algorithm development for crossing the gridlines on the gameboard.</li>
                </ol>
                <br><br>
                <b>Website:</b><br>
                &emsp; The homepage was mostly completed. This encompasses the description of the Wumpus World Problem,
                a spot for a picture of Shaggy, a description of board tiles, and group members.
                <br><br>
                &emsp; In addition, we have decided to keep the name Shaggy for our robot, agreed on the team name “The
                Ports,” and made a mildly temporary logo, all of which was uploaded to the website.
                <br><br>
                <b>Grid Traversal:</b><br>
                &emsp; The first step in tackling the problem was to get sample boards, allowing us to explore possible
                methodologies for solving the board. Fortunately, one of our group members already made a board
                generator, speeding up the progress. With these boards, we discussed how we would solve each generated
                board. With enough examples, we could begin formulating a high-level view of the algorithm. Toward the
                end of class, we had a very good grasp of our algorithm and subsequently demonstrated it to Professor
                Bram.
                <br><br>
                <b>Gridline Traversal:</b><br>
                &emsp; The sample code gave us a basic outline of traversing over a line. Based upon this, we explored
                the code’s shortfalls and issues to start reverse-engineering an algorithm based on the provided code.
                In addition, this code gave us a good understanding of how to properly implement the light sensors into
                our own program.

                &emsp; Like the previous session, each member worked towards completing the subtask they were working on
                in the other class. Updates to each subsection were as follows:
                <br><br>
                <b>Website:</b><br>
                &emsp; Today was the day for Shaggy to shine. We took pictures of our robot (that were outdated by the
                end of class) and added them to the website. In addition, the homepage was reorganized to describe the
                project, which moved information about the robot and group members to its own page. On this page, we
                could describe what a Shaggy is, what components a Shaggy must have, and who Shaggy’s current commanders
                are.
                <br><br>
                <b>Grid Traversal:</b><br>
                &emsp; In this class, we got to work on writing the algorithm in Python. We started to implement a class
                to represent a square on the grid. This task proved more difficult than first expected as we were very
                rusty with Python syntax. Despite the setbacks, we were able to complete the grid-square class. With
                this in hand, we started to code the algorithm into Python. The first part of the algorithm to be
                implemented was the logic to determine which squares are empty spaces.
                <br><br>
                <b>Gridline Traversal:</b><br>
                &emsp; Building on the day before, we started building pseudocode for the line traversal. After writing
                some combination of Java, Python, and pseudocode on paper, we reviewed whether the conditions would
                execute as expected. The algorithm was not completed today; however, it was getting closer to
                completion.
                <br><br>
                &emsp; In addition, we realized the position of our light sensors behind the wheels would make our robot
                unable to safely traverse the landscape. As a result, we moved the sensors from the back of the robot to
                the front.
