        &emsp;Today, we were introduced to our robot named Shaggy. In addition, we were responsible for disassembling last year’s Shaggy. After disassembly, we counted, inspected, and organized the lego pieces into the correct compartments. Later on, we learned the game's objective, the rules surrounding it, and where to find instructions and sample code for the project.

          &emsp;To start the day, we had to find our robot. It appears another group borrowed our robot, and we went on
          a heist to liberate him. In addition, we did a quick, fifteen-minute lecture about Git/GitHub so that we may
          effectively share the code with each other. While listening to the lecture, some members were also building
          the robot, and by the end of the class, we were very close to having the robot completely built physically. In
          addition to building the robot, we looked over the example code and could make some of the code run. While we
          were able to get the sample code to run, we could not get our own code to run on the robot.
          <br><br>
          &emsp;In addition, we had a well-crafted README made so that other group members do not need to struggle as
          much as the first member. <small><i> We believe this readme was uploaded to the project website; future

                &emsp; Today, everyone had a different role and task to complete. The three biggest tasks were as
                follows:
                <ol>
                    <li>Further website development.</li>
                    <li>Algorithm development for safe grid travel.</li>
                    <li>Algorithm development for crossing the gridlines on the gameboard.</li>
                </ol>
                <br><br>
                <b>Website:</b><br>
                &emsp; The homepage was mostly completed. This encompasses the description of the Wumpus World Problem,
                a spot for a picture of Shaggy, a description of board tiles, and group members.
                <br><br>
                &emsp; In addition, we have decided to keep the name Shaggy for our robot, agreed on the team name “The
                Ports,” and made a mildly temporary logo, all of which was uploaded to the website.
                <br><br>
                <b>Grid Traversal:</b><br>
                &emsp; The first step in tackling the problem was to get sample boards, allowing us to explore possible
                methodologies for solving the board. Fortunately, one of our group members already made a board
                generator, speeding up the progress. With these boards, we discussed how we would solve each generated
                board. With enough examples, we could begin formulating a high-level view of the algorithm. Toward the
                end of class, we had a very good grasp of our algorithm and subsequently demonstrated it to Professor
                Bram.
                <br><br>
                <b>Gridline Traversal:</b><br>
                &emsp; The sample code gave us a basic outline of traversing over a line. Based upon this, we explored
                the code’s shortfalls and issues to start reverse-engineering an algorithm based on the provided code.
                In addition, this code gave us a good understanding of how to properly implement the light sensors into
                our own program.

                &emsp; Like the previous session, each member worked towards completing the subtask they were working on
                in the other class. Updates to each subsection were as follows:
                <br><br>
                <b>Website:</b><br>
                &emsp; Today was the day for Shaggy to shine. We took pictures of our robot (that were outdated by the
                end of class) and added them to the website. In addition, the homepage was reorganized to describe the
                project, which moved information about the robot and group members to its own page. On this page, we
                could describe what a Shaggy is, what components a Shaggy must have, and who Shaggy’s current commanders
                are.
                <br><br>
                <b>Grid Traversal:</b><br>
                &emsp; In this class, we got to work on writing the algorithm in Python. We started to implement a class
                to represent a square on the grid. This task proved more difficult than first expected as we were very
                rusty with Python syntax. Despite the setbacks, we were able to complete the grid-square class. With
                this in hand, we started to code the algorithm into Python. The first part of the algorithm to be
                implemented was the logic to determine which squares are empty spaces.
                <br><br>
                <b>Gridline Traversal:</b><br>
                &emsp; Building on the day before, we started building pseudocode for the line traversal. After writing
                some combination of Java, Python, and pseudocode on paper, we reviewed whether the conditions would
                execute as expected. The algorithm was not completed today; however, it was getting closer to
                completion.
                <br><br>
                &emsp; In addition, we realized the position of our light sensors behind the wheels would make our robot
                unable to safely traverse the landscape. As a result, we moved the sensors from the back of the robot to
                the front.

        <div class="card-body">
            <p class="fw-light">
                &emsp; Today was a very special day as we got our own code to run on Shaggy. To force him to cooperate,
                we had to give him a Scooby Snack. The Scooby Snack in question was in the form of removing carriage
                returns from our code. Unbeknownst to us, our code was formatted in CRLF, which would terminate lines
                with ‘\r\n.’ Unfortunately, Linux only supports lines that end with ‘\n,’ which is why our robot has
                been unable to run any other code than the sample code. And to that, we have to say Zoinks Scoob!
                <br><br>
                &emsp; Unfortunately, solving that issue took much longer than expected.<small><i> Groups of the future,
                this issue is now in the document, you’re welcome</i></small> As a result, progress on the robot was
                slowed. Despite this, other members were able to complete more tasks in this project. The tasks are the
                same as before, with the addition of a somewhat distinct subtask of making the robot rotate. The updates
                to these subtasks are as follows:
                <br><br>
                <b>Website:</b><br>
                &emsp; This task took the biggest hit when the robot was unable to have code run on it. This is due to
                the group member responsible for the website taking a slight detour into this issue, which took much
                longer than they expected.
                <br><br>
                &emsp; Despite this, some progress was made, mostly in between classes. First, a to-do list was
                constructed. This list was made to be used by our group; however, it may eventually be uploaded to the
                website to further show what tasks we were able to complete and allow others to see what tasks we
                decided needed to be completed.
                <br><br>
                &emsp; We also found a good place to put the design descriptions and set up the header for this. Also,
                we were able to add another group mate to the group members' bio on the about us page.
                <br><br>
                <b>Grid Traversal:</b><br>
                &emsp; Further implementation of the algorithm was achieved. We were able to add the rule sets for
                identifying holes and the wumpus into the code. The biggest struggles in implementation were remembering
                how the algorithm functions and double-checking that the algorithm does what we expect it to do.
                <br><br>
                <b>Gridline Traversal:</b><br>
                &emsp; Developed and implemented pseudocode based on a sample for robot alignment when in motion. Since
                the robot doesn’t know its relative position in space, to prevent it from veering off the path it will
                start/stop motors based on light intensity values returned by the light sensors. Light intensity values
                <50 is black, and >50 are white. If the values of both the left and right light sensors are black, the
                robot proceeds forward for a set distance. If the robot receives opposite color values from the sensors,
                the motor on the same side of the sensor that saw white will shut off, while the other motor continues
                until that light sensor see’s white.
                <br><br>
                <b>Rotation:</b><br>
                Before class started, functions to rotate the robot were implemented. Despite this, we were unsure if
                the code would work as there were many variables unable to be tested without the robot or adequate
                documentation. We learned many things in this class. For example, the gyro treats counter-clockwise as
                positive, which was different than our expectation, making the robot rotate in the wrong direction. In
                addition, we learned how to properly get the max speed of the motors (and the incorrect ways to as
                well). The last biggest takeaway we learned was that the motors automatically invert the polarity of the
                wheels for us. This is very unexpected as the left, and right motors are flipped horizontally, which
                would invert one of their directions. After realizing these issues, we were able to successfully get
                Shaggy to rotate accurately and may proceed to other subtasks.

                &emsp; The code responsible for the robot's line traversal developed on Day 5 was tested for the first
                time, it was a failure. Instead of the robot stopping when either sensor detected a line, it would stop
                afterward, positioning it between 2 grid spaces, then continuing indefinitely. We ended up rewriting the
                line traversal/alignment code through trial and error. The end result for line traversal was a robot
                that approached lines at slow speeds for the sake of not overshooting the light sensors. This gave us
                the best chance of the robot aligning itself parallel with the board. It would then traverse into the
                adjacent black and continue to the next line, once this occurs the robot would then traverse backward
                and align itself at the center of the grid box by having the distance traveled from the start to the 2nd
                line. This code was then combined with the previously developed rotation code which after a few tests
                would execute properly to various degrees of success. On average after the robot completed transversal
                to the adjacent square followed by a 90-degree swivel, the robot would end up in the bottom corner
                instead of the center of the grid box. We concluded this was due to the value calculated for the robot
                to backtrack to the center of the grid square before the rotation being off.
                <br><br>
                &emsp; This was the day of Shaggy's big performance at that night’s plenary meeting. But like Mariah
                Carey, he sang his soul out while being stationary. The timeline of the algorithm being completed and
                integrated with the line traversal code did not align with our performance deadline. But despite that
                Shaggy was still given a standing ovation.
                <br><br>
                &emsp; Completely rewrote the logic algorithm after hitting a wall using the last one. Increased the
                number of variables stored in each instance of the square class, and increased the number of conditions
                that the robot tests for in each square. The new algorithm keeps track of the amount of adjacent squares
                whose contents are known and for each square keeps track of what items cannot be in that square. It
                implements new logic to automatically assign contents to a spot if it is the only available spot and the
                robot receives a clue. Also implemented logic that if a square has an item in its list of things it
                cannot be, and the robot receives a clue for that item, it will skip over that square for consideration.
