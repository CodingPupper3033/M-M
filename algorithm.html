                gets closer to the desired angle, it will turn slower to make more accurate adjustments. These
                adjustments will occur until the angle difference is within the specified accuracy range (declared as a
                constant in the code.)

                &emsp; Since the board must always be solvable using perfect logic, it can be deduced that the starting
                space and the two spaces adjacent to it must be safe. In order for a space to be safe it cannot contain
                either a hole or the Wumpus. It is important to note that if a space has gold on it, it is still
                considered safe. The robot will then move to the next spot; this will be determined by first seeing
                which surrounding spots are safe. The robot can only go to spaces that it knows are safe. It then sees
                which spots have already been visited as it will prioritize traveling to unvisited spots over ones it
                has already been to. If at this point there isn’t a clear direction for the robot to move in, it will
                pick to move up first, if it can’t do that, it will try to move left, then right, then down. In the case
                of moving off the starting space, the robot will choose to move up. Here it will receive a hint about
                the spaces surrounding it. If it receives nothing, the robot can be sure that all surrounding spaces are
                empty. If it feels a breeze or smells a stench, it assigns a chance of there being a hole (if it feels a
                breeze) or the Wumpus (if it smells a stench) in every space that does not already have some contents
                assigned to it. If the robot smells a stench, but it knows that one of the adjacent spots holds the
                Wumpus, it will not assign any more spots the chance of having a Wumpus. If the robot is ever certain of
                the Wumpus’ location, it will kill it, this will empty the spot and provide new possible spaces to
                explore. If the robot gets to a spot and feels a breeze, any adjacent spot that already has the chance
                of being a hole can be said to be a hole. If the robot ever gets to a spot that has only one neighbor
                whose contents have not been determined, if the clue does not match the contents of any other adjacent
                spot, it can say for certain that that clue is pertaining to that spot. Similar logic applies to the
                gold as applies to holes or the Wumpus. Any time the robot sees a glimmer, it will assign all open
                adjacent spots a chance of having the gold. This time, however, the presence of the chance of gold does
                not make a square unsafe, allowing the robot to move into any square with only the chance of gold
                without being sure of the gold’s location. If the robot sees a glimmer and one of the adjacent spots has
                the chance of being the gold, the robot will make the assumption that that spot holds the gold. Once the
                robot is sure of the gold’s location it will immediately move into that square. In order to get back to
                the starting spot, the robot will use a sort of guess and check system using breadcrumbs. It will try to
                get back by prioritizing moving down, then left, then right, then up. It will only travel back to spaces
                that it has visited already. Upon entering a space, the robot will “place a breadcrumb” this will allow
                it to keep track of the number of times it has been to this space on its way back. The robot will always
                try to move toward the space with the fewest breadcrumbs, and if two adjacent spaces have the same
                amount, it will follow the before-mentioned series of directions. After some amount of time, this will
                get the robot safely back to its starting point.
