## TODO List:

- [x] Team Members Description (image + desired title + sentence about you) - **Still waiting on Anish - Got sick of
  waiting, needed to move on. If you ever respond I can try to add it**
- [ ] What choices were made in physical design? - Ziv & Josh
- [ ] Log Book - Josh (And Further Help from others)
- [ ] Resources on the website (like this list) - Josh
- [ ] Fully Fleshed out light sensing/grid traversal algorithm - Ziv
- [x] Fully Fleshed out traversal algorithm - Patrick & Anish
- [ ] High Level not too detailed explanation of the algorithm - Patrick
- [ ] Implemented light sensing/grid traversal algorithm - Ziv (maybe Josh if needed)
- [ ] Implementation of general grid traversal (~~rotating~~, moving to spot, knowing where the robot is) - Unknown.
  Sort of
- [x] Implementation of communication to the robot (SSH) - Up for grabs. If Ziv finishes light sensing, maybe him? - **
  just just input() and print()**
  all hands on deck, Josh included?
- [ ] Implemented traversal algorithm - Anish & Patrick
- [ ] Is the robot intelligent, conscious, mindful? Is AI feasible? - Up for grabs; maybe Anish?
- [ ] Team Logo - Josh - ~~Asking, may need to use old one~~ Should get by before Friday
- [ ] "The Works!" - Up for grabs
- [ ] Discussion on roundup - Tentatively Josh but hopefully not
