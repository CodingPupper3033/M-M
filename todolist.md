## TODO List:

- [x] Team Members Description (image + desired title + sentence about you)
- [x] What choices were made in physical design?
- [x] Log Book - Josh (And Further Help from others)
- [x] Resources on the website (like this list)
- [x] Fully Fleshed out light sensing/grid traversal algorithm
- [x] Fully Fleshed out traversal algorithm
- [x] High Level not too detailed explanation of the algorithm
- [x] Implemented light sensing/grid traversal algorithm
- [x] Implementation of general grid traversal (rotating, moving to spot, knowing where the robot is)
- [x] Implementation of communication to the robot (SSH) - **just just input() and print()**
- [x] Implemented traversal algorithm
- [ ] Is the robot intelligent, conscious, mindful? Is AI feasible?
- [x] Team Logo
- [x] "The Works!"
- [ ] Discussion on roundup - Tentatively Josh but hopefully not
